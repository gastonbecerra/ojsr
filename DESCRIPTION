Description: This package allows you to crawl OJS pages and retrieve meta-data from articles. 
    The aim of this package is to aid you in several OJS tasks, such as: 
    parse OJS urls, according to routing conventions;
    crawling archives, issues, articles, galleys; 
    and retrieving/scraping meta-data from articles.
    Keep in mind that ojsr rely on OJS routing conventions, 
    and it is most likely to fail on OJS installments with customized routing.
