Description: Crawler for 'OJS' pages and scraper for meta-data from articles. 
    You can crawl 'OJS' archives, issues, articles, galleys, and search results. 
    You can scrape articles metadata from their head tag in html, 
    or from Open Archives Initiative ('OAI') records.
    Most of these functions rely on 'OJS' routing conventions 
    (<https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/documentation/en/architecture-routes>).
