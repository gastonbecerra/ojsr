Description: ojsr allows you to crawl OJS pages and retrieve meta-data from articles. 
    You can crawl OJS archives, issues, articles, galleys, and search results. 
    You can scrap articles meta-data from their head tag in html, or from OAI records.
    Most of ojsr functiones rely on OJS routing conventions 
    (<https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/documentation/en/architecture-routes>), 
    and are most likely to fail on OJS installments with customized routing.
